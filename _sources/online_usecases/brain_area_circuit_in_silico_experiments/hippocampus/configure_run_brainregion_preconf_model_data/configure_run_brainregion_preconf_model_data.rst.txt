Configure and run a rat hippocampus CA1 region using preconfigured HBP model and data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~



This use case allows a user to configure and launch a simulation on HBP HPAC infrastructure using `Unicore API <https://www.unicore.eu/>`__.

Run Simulations
===============

|run_simulation|


In the **Section 1)** you can configure:

-  ``Population``: Population of cells to be loaded by the simulator.
-  ``Duration``: Time length of stimulus duration, given in
   milliseconds(ms)
-  ``View Simulations``: From here you can see all the history of
   simulations (explained in page `View Simulations <#view-simulations>`_)


In the **Section 2)** you can configure:


-  Using the buttons |edit_buttons| you can ``add``, ``edit`` or ``remove`` new stimulus/report (You can also
   double-click on the timeline to add or edit)

-  ``Stimulations`` configuration:

  -  *Population*: Name of a population to receive the stimulation
  -  *Delay*: Time when the stimulus commences, given in
     milliseconds (ms)
  -  *Duration*: Time length of stimulus duration, given in
     milliseconds (ms)
  -  *Pattern*: Type of stimulus to inject
  -  *AmpStart*: The amount of current initially injected when the stimulus activates (nA)
  -  *AmpEnd*: The final current when a stimulus concludes. Used by Linear (nA)

    |edit_stimulus|

-  ``Reports``

  -  *Population*: Defines the population from where the data will be reported.
  -  *StartTime*: Time to start reporting (ms)
  -  *EndTime*: Time to stop reporting (ms)
  -  *Compartments*: Which compartment(s) to report [Soma = compartment, Soma + Dendrites = AllCompartments]
  -  *ReportOn*: What to report [Voltage, Calcium Concentration, Current Summation (for LFP)]
  -  *dt*: The frequency of reporting in milliseconds (ms)
  -  *Format*: Defines the report output format [Binary (.bbp), ASCII, HDF5]

    |edit_report|


In the **Section 3)** you can modify the **connection** between populations on the circuit specifying:

- *Source:* This target defines presynaptic cells
- *Destination:* This target defines postsynaptic cells
- *Delay (ms):* A delay after which the modifications are applied
- *Weight:* A scaling factor to adjust the synaptic strength (default = 1)
- *MinisFreq:* The Poisson mean rate for spontaneous synaptic activity
- *Synapse Configuration:* Snippets of hoc code to manipulate additional synaptic parameters

  |connection_manipulation|

  - If you want to modify a synpase just click *configure* and a pop-up will appear

    |synapse_configurator|

In the **Section 4)**  you can modify the **projection** going to the circuit

- *Weight:* A scaling factor to adjust the synaptic strength (default = 1)
- *Minis Projection:* Generate inputs based on spontaneous synaptic activity
  - *Frequency (Hz):* Frequency of the spontaneous synaptic activity
- *Spike Replay Projection:* Generate inputs based on a given distribution

  - *Target:* From which cells the projection is coming
  - *Frequency (Hz):* The input mean rate
  - *Stimulus Type:* Type of distribution (default = Poisson)

    |projection_manipulation|

  - If you want to modify a projection just click *configure* and a pop-up will appear

    |projection_edition|

- Launching a simulation will open a form to configure the parameters before executing the jobs on the supercomputer

 - *Title*: The title of the job
 - *Computer*: Which supercomputer will run the simulation.
 - *Project*: (optional) If you want to specify under which project the simulation should be run
 - *Nodes*: The amount of nodes that will be allocated and used for the simulation
 - *Run Time*: The maximum time before timeout (in seconds).
 - *CPUs Per Node*: Number of CPUs that are going to be used for the simulation.
 - *Total Processors*: The total amount (nodes * cpus).
 - *Preview BlueConfig*: This will open a new tab with the complete configuration that is going to be sent

-  ``Check status`` of Simulation and Analysis steps:

   - ready |done|
   - queue |sync|
   - aborted |block|

-  ``View`` the details page of the simulation.

-  ``Analyse`` will open a form to configure the parameters before executing the analysis on the supercomputer

   -  *Title*: Title of the job
   -  *Report*: Report created by the simulation
   -  *Raster / Traces*: (Basic Analysis) Type of analysis to run
         -  *Whole Population*: Population cells
         -  *Cells GIDs*: Specify single GID and/or ranges of GIDs
         -  *Random Cells*: Amount of random cells (from the report) to analyze


      |run_analysis_form|
