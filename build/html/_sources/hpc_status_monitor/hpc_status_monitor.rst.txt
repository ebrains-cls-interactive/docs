HPC Status Monitor
##################

The HPC Status Monitor allows to check the status of the HPC systems available 
for job submission from the HBP Collaboratory and the remaining quotas reserved 
to the user on each of them. 

In order to run a job in the HPC systems, the HBP user needs to be
mapped on and to be part of (at least) a project on those systems.
If the user does not have any access and allocation to any systems, she/he can 
still submit jobs (with limited quotas) through the available service accounts.
For further details on the service account please refer to the dedicated 
:ref:`service_account` documentation.

*****************
HPC system status
*****************

The HPC Status Monitor's top panel indicates the status of the HPC systems and whether
they provide the Service Account submission functionality (see Fig. 1).
The green icon indicates that the system is running while the red cross
shows the system and/or the Service Account for that system is not currently 
available. 

The refresh and info icons, in the top right part of the panel, allow to 
update the HPC system status and open the HPC monitor Guidebook page
respectively.

*********************************
HPC system status: user's details
*********************************

After clicking on any of the HPC system names in the top panel, the **User's 
Details** section unfolds and the user's quotas (including the Service Account
one) as well as the corresponding projects are shown (see Fig. 2). 
While an HPC system might be online (i.e. the green icon is shown in the top 
panel) the user might not be able to submit jobs on that system (for example if 
the default node for job submission is temporarily unavailable). 

In order to check whether the user is able to submit
a job on a specific project, a **Check** button is displayed on the rightmost 
column of the user's details panel. The button's status changes, namely turns 
into the green or the red cross icon, depending on the possibility for the user 
to submit job at the moment of checking.

In case the user does not have any quota on a system, or the query has not been
successful, an error message is displayed (see Fig. 3).
