Interactive Workflows and Use Cases
***********************************

The EBRAINS Cellular Level Simulation Interactive Workflows and Use Cases is 
part of the EBRAINS Research Infrastructure ecosystem.
It aims at providing scientists with powerful tools to reconstruct and simulate 
scaffold models of brain and brain tissue in a data-driven fashion. 

A tight co-design loop between science and engineering ensures the required 
substantial technical and scientific innovations. As a result, the unique 
functionality of the platform allows novel questions to be addressed, which 
could previously not be researched.
